Servlet filter for Restful web service interface. Filter requests by request destinations, users. Response of web service can encrypt for selected webservices or all. Configurations has to be define in rusty-config file. Client side of rusty has feature to prevent web service replay attacks and decrypt data of web service if secured. 

Users and destination management is highly customizable and currently those have to define in rusty-config.xml

We are looking forward to integrate LDAP or any other database to manage users and destinations.
